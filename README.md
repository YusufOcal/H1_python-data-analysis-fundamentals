# Data Analysis Fundamentals with Python

This repository contains fundamental data analysis exercises using Python, focusing on the basic concepts of data manipulation, analysis, and visualization with NumPy and Pandas libraries.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates basic data science workflows using two datasets:
- **Penguins Dataset**: Contains measurements of different penguin species
- **Titanic Dataset**: Contains passenger information from the Titanic disaster

## Contents

- `Hafta_1_Odev.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the analysis exercises
- `1.hafta.ipynb`: Introduction to Python, NumPy, and Pandas with examples
- `penguins.csv`: Dataset containing penguin measurements and characteristics
- `titanic.csv`: Dataset containing Titanic passenger information

## Key Features

- Basic data loading and exploration
- Data manipulation and cleaning
- Working with missing values
- Data filtering and selection
- Data aggregation and grouping
- Statistical analysis

## Topics Covered

1. **Introduction to Google Colab**
2. **Python Basics for Machine Learning**
   - NumPy fundamentals
   - Array operations
   - Matrix manipulation
3. **Pandas for Data Analysis**
   - DataFrame basics
   - Data selection and filtering
   - Handling missing data
   - Data grouping and aggregation
4. **Basic Machine Learning Concepts**
   - Features and labels
   - Working with datasets

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab

## Usage

You can run the Jupyter notebooks locally or in Google Colab by opening the `.ipynb` files.

```python
# Example code for loading the datasets
import pandas as pd

# Load penguins dataset
penguins_df = pd.read_csv('penguins.csv')

# Load titanic dataset
titanic_df = pd.read_csv('titanic.csv')
```
